# Fashion-MNIST---ANN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working on the MNIST database. The MNIST data is a database of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The database contains 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images. Task is to create an ANN model for identifying the digit from the handwritten images.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performed the following tasks:

Load the database to variable named digit_mnist using the Keras inbuilt datasets (digit_mnist = keras.datasets.mnist)
Import data to create X_train_full, y_train_full, X_test and y_test variables
Normalize the data
Create a validation set of 6000 images
Create an ANN model with two dense layers of 200 and 100 neurons
Compile and train the model for 60 epochs
Plot the loss and accuracy against epoch
Evaluate the model accuracy on the test dataset
Predict the digit for the first 5 records of the test dataset
